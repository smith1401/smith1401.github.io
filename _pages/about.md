title: "About Me"
---

I am a researcher with a strong emphasis on robotics, sensors, embedded software, navigation, and SLAM. Throughout my career, I have dedicated my studies to Geomatics Engineering at Graz University of Technology, where I specialized in applying advanced technologies to autonomous systems. Managing and overseeing research projects aimed at enabling robots to navigate autonomously has provided me with invaluable experience.

At present, I am actively involved in groundbreaking research focused on autonomous navigation and localization of robots in complex environments. To achieve this, I am leveraging state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms in conjunction with Factor-graph optimization. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that empower robots to operate proficiently in demanding real-world scenarios.

The field of robotics has always captivated me, particularly the challenge of creating robots capable of excelling in dynamic and unpredictable surroundings. I find immense satisfaction in pushing the boundaries of what robots can accomplish, unlocking new possibilities through the integration of cutting-edge technologies.

By combining my passion for robotics with my expertise in navigation, sensors, and software development, I strive to contribute to the advancement of autonomous systems. My ultimate objective is to enhance the capabilities of robots and enable them to navigate and adapt seamlessly in challenging and ever-changing environments.
